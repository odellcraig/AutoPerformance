The output directory will be given to the client who will append to the files:

Downstream/Summary_Tcp.csv
Upstream/Summary_Tcp.csv 
Downstream/Summary_Udp.csv
Upstream/Summary_Udp.csv 

With the summary data. Each line will be represented with a time run
that is generated with: time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S") to parse 
that time use the same format (see time) for examples.

Additionally, for the full results of the run of a TCP test, the output
will be sent to directory under the filename: Downstream/time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")_Tcp.csv 
and Upstream/time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")_Tcp.csv
Note that the summary line will be at the bottom of this file but since time.strftime is 
potentially called at slightly different times, the Summary_Tcp.csv corresponding line 
may not match exactly.
