	* TODO: Close done items.

2006-08-20 19:46  fedemp

	* src/client.c: Use quantiles to report delay and jitter instead of
	  min/max/avg. In verbose mode, min/max/avg are also shown in
	  reports.  Two quantile sequences are kept for each stream (one
	  for per interval reports and one for final reports) as well as a
	  sequence for global final statistics -unless just one stream is
	  used, in which case only two sequences are kept.

	  Added a new function (required_quantile_seqs) and two #defines to
	  handle quantile sequence numbers.

	  Added a new error code for errors in the quantile algorithm.

2006-08-20 15:56  fedemp

	* src/server.c: Updated calls to quantile functions (new sequence
	  number parameter, which is always 0 in the server).

2006-08-20 15:54  fedemp

	* src/: reporting.c, reporting.h: Extend quantile functions so that
	  more than 1 sequences can be handled in parallel (required to
	  compute delay and jitter in the thrulay client if multiple
	  streams are used). Most quantile functions now have an extra
	  parameter to specify what sequence must be modified.
	  quantile_init has an extra parameter to set the number of
	  sequences to be used.

2006-08-19 22:56  fedemp

	* src/: server.c, server.h: Additional documentation and use
	  'const' wherever possible in the API.

2006-08-19 21:21  fedemp

	* thrulay.spec.in: Updated for recent releases of rpmbuild.

2006-08-19 21:21  fedemp

	* src/thrulayd.c: Updated to use return codes from the thrulay
	  server functions.

2006-08-19 21:20  fedemp

	* src/: server.c, server.h: Return codes added to all server API
	  functions. Calls to exit() inside the library have been replaced
	  with return codes. Before daemonizing, calls to
	  error(ERR_FATAL,...) have been replaced with return codes After
	  daemonizing, calls to exit() have been replaced as well with
	  return codes (most of which will not be accessible unless the low
	  level thrulay_server_process_client function is used).

	  Additional checks replacing assert() calls and unchecked error
	  conditions.  New function, thrulay_server_strerror, to retrieve
	  descriptions of error return codes.

	  Documentation extended. New function in server.c, tcp_test
	  (equivalent to udp_test).

2006-08-19 16:58  fedemp

	* src/reporting.c: Report just the 5 metrics in the draft.

2006-08-19 16:54  fedemp

	* src/thrulay.c: Check return codes of the client interface.

2006-08-19 16:53  fedemp

	* src/: client.c, client.h, util.c: Return codes have been added to
	  most of the client API functions.  New function for the client
	  API: thrulay_client_strerror. A new array of char*,
	  thrulay_client_error_s, holds the error strings, that can be
	  retrieved using thrulay_client_strerror. As a side effect, some
	  asserts have been removed and additional checks have been
	  introduced.  Documentation of the API has been improved a bit.

	  The idea has been replacing error(ERR_FATAL,...) calls with
	  return codes that can be handled by the application using
	  libthrulay, as it does not seem very polite to exit() inside the
	  library without giving any opportunity of retrying or somehow
	  handling the error.

	  See bwlib for an example in which bwctl control error messages
	  are generated. Another example is the thrulay command line tools.

2006-08-19 16:52  fedemp

	* src/server.c: Report just the 5 metrics from the draft unless
	  verbose output is requested.

2006-08-19 01:16  fedemp

	* src/server.c: Include sys/select.h only if available (and assume
	  select() is defined somewhere else -sys/time.h for example on
	  some HP-UX).

	  (udp_test): removed local variable graceful_termination, as it is
	  not used.

2006-08-19 01:14  fedemp

	* src/client.c: (thrulay_udp_init): removed local variable addrlen,
	  as it is not used anymore.

	  (thrulay_tcp_start): use socklen_t instead of unsigned int.

2006-08-19 01:10  fedemp

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Use GCC style C standard and
	  warning flags only when gcc is detected.

2006-08-18 17:38  fedemp

	* src/client.c: Suppress output if verbosity < 0.

2006-08-18 17:37  fedemp

	* src/server.c: Use PRIu64 for uint64_t variables in printf so as
	  to avoid warnings on 64-bit platforms.

2006-08-15 20:11  fedemp

	* src/: server.c, server.h: Changes to enable cross-compilation to
	  Windows (XP or later) using MinGW32. Comments for the

	  spawned for serving each client.

2006-08-15 19:59  fedemp

	  for Windows (XP and later) using MinGW32.

2006-08-15 19:53  fedemp

2006-06-29 19:03  fedemp

	* src/: server.c, server.h, thrulayd.c, thrulayd.h: New thrulay
	  server API added. thrulayd.c parses command line options and
	  relies on the server API for anything else. acl_allow_add added
	  to the server API, as well as defines for default port and window
	  size.

2006-06-28 18:00  fedemp

	* src/: thrulay.c, thrulay.h, thrulayd.c, thrulayd.h: thrulay.c and

	  reordering_init.

2006-06-14 18:52  fedemp

	  obviates the need for ``rm -rf CVS'' bits in the various
	  Makefile.in files.

2005-10-02 19:44  shalunov

	* configure.ac: Change thrulay-dev to thrulay-users as the bug
	  reporting address.  (The hope is that this way, we might get some

	  confirmations of bugs.)

2005-10-02 19:34  shalunov
