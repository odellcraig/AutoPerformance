<h1>thrulay, network capacity tester</h1>

<p>The program <code>thrulay</code> is used to measure the capacity,
delay, and other performance metrics of a network by sending a bulk
TCP or UDP stream over it.

<p>Special features of <code>thrulay</code> include:
<ul>

<li>For TCP, ability to measure round-trip delay along with throughput

<li>For UDP, ability to measure

    <ul>

    <li>one-way delay, with quantiles

    <li>packet loss

    <li>packet duplication

    <li>reordering

    </ul>

<li>For UDP, the ability to send precisely positioned true Poisson
    streams (microsecond errors in sending times)

<li>Human- and machine-readable output (ready to be fed to gnuplot)

</ul>
